# Salary-Prediction-Project-Streamlit
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition and estimating salaries based on various employee attributes. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about employees, including their age, gender, department, job title, years at the company, satisfaction level, average monthly hours, promotion history, salary, and attrition status.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files:

README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

gui.py: A Streamlit application that allows users to input employee details and get salary predictions using different machine learning models.

linear_regression_model.pkl: A serialized linear regression model is used for salary prediction.

prediction.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

scaler.pkl: A serialized StandardScaler is used to normalize the input data.

svm_model.pkl: A serialized Support Vector Machine (SVM) model used for salary prediction.
## Dataset
